    <h1>Two-Ingredient Ice Cream Sandwiches</h1>
    <img src="img/icecreamsandwich.jpg" alt="Ice Cream Sandwich">
    <p>When it comes to dessert, sometimes you just want a little nibble. Or sometimes little hands are reaching for a treat. Or sometimes you want to house half a package of cookies and an entire pint of ice cream in one sitting, and you’ve been looking for more creative ways to do it. In any of the above scenarios, I’m hard pressed to find a more universally beloved combination than Oreos and ice cream. Cookies ‘n’ cream is historically often cast aside as a kids’ flavor, and I find that unfair and inaccurate. In this two ingredient recipe, I’m bringing justice back to Oreos and ice cream by packaging them as simple, adorable mini ice cream sandwiches that will be popular with kids and adults alike.</p>
