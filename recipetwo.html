    <h1>Two-Ingredient Ice Cream Sandwiches</h1>
    <img src="img/icecreamsandwich.jpg" width="300" alt="Ice Cream Sandwich" style="border: 3px solid black;">
    <p>When it comes to dessert, sometimes you just want a little nibble. Or sometimes little hands are reaching for a treat. Or sometimes you want to house half a package of cookies and an entire pint of ice cream in one sitting, and you’ve been looking for more creative ways to do it. In any of the above scenarios, I’m hard pressed to find a more universally beloved combination than Oreos and ice cream. Cookies ‘n’ cream is historically often cast aside as a kids’ flavor, and I find that unfair and inaccurate. In this two ingredient recipe, I’m bringing justice back to Oreos and ice cream by packaging them as simple, adorable mini ice cream sandwiches that will be popular with kids and adults alike.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 Oreo Sandwich Cookies</li>
        <li>One pint ice cream of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>How to Prepare:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mold the Ice Cream</li>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Fold the ice cream in parchment paper and roll it into a log-shape. Wrap tightly and place in the freezer for, roughly, 1 hour.</p>
        <li>Prepare the oreos</li>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Twist them open and remove the filling with the help of a knife. Set the 16 cookie halves aside.</p>
        <li>Slice the Ice Cream</li>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Once solid, slice the ice cream log in, approximately, 16 even slices utilizing a sharp, thin knife.</p>
        <li>Assemble</li>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Place one ice cream disc on every upturned cookie and top with the other cookies half. Place in the freezer and wait between 8 to 12 hours for them to solidify before eating!</p>
    </ol>
